<h1>Assigning Roles</h1>

<p>
When assigning roles to a private meeting it is always good practice to assign at 
least 1 host or presenter who will be present in the meeting; because users with 
the participant role will be unable to join the meeting unless a user with the 
host or presenter roles has already joined th meeting.
</p>

<p>
If the meeting has support for separate groups at least 1 user in each group, who is
to be present in the meeting, should have either the host or presenter role.
</p>

<p>
By assigning a role to a user in a context, you 
are granting them the permissions contained
in that role, for the current context and all 
"lower" contexts.
</p>

<p>
Contexts:
</p>
<ol>
<li>System (the entire installation)</li>
<li>Front page (the "site course")</li>
<li>Course Categories</li>
<li>Course Sub-categories</li>
<li>Courses</li>
<li>Blocks and Activities</li>
</ol>

<p>
So for example, if you grant a Student role to a 
user in a Course, they will have that role for 
the course, but also all Blocks and Activities inside
that course.  Their actual permissions may depend on 
other roles and overrides that have been defined.
