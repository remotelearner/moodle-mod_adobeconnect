<p>The Adobe Connect Pro activity module provides the officially sponsored integration 
method between Moodle and Adobe Connect Pro. It was developed in conjunction with the Remote-Learner 
development team and Adobe Inc. It is designed to simplify the use of synchronous events within Moodle. 
It provides a single sign on between the two systems with easy event creation and management.</p>
